## Serving Robot - Purpose and Description

The Serving Robot is a hardware and software project aimed at assisting hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic and easing the serving process in restaurants. This robot is designed to carry items, meals, medicines, and other essential supplies from one location to another autonomously. The robot uses various components, including motors, a wooden chassis, NodeMCU ESP8266, L298N motor driver, wheels, a lithium-ion battery, switches, and a battery meter. The integration of these components results in an intelligent and reliable serving robot.
